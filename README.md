The idea behind this experiment is to create a fast, web-based image browser that connects over webdav. Created with the idea of using a [Ravpower Filehub](http://www.ravpower.com/ravpower-rp-wd01-filehub-3000mah-power-bank.html) or similar wifi shared drive for photo storage and backup using [custom firmware](https://github.com/digidem/filehub-config)

This is very much experimental at this stage. Test out the image thumbnail browsing here: http://bl.ocks.org/gmaclennan/11130600

You will need to setup lighttpd to test it locally, and point it to a folder of images.
